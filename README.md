        <h2><b>About Me</b></h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, I am Jhanvi I just moved here from Punjab to study <b>Interactive Media Design</b>. I started classes of Graphic Design to improve my skills in <em>digital art, logos, portrait, illustartions and many more...</em> In my free time, i love to listen music and sometimes cooking. The best part of my day is to spend some time with my family and share the moments of my whole day. <mark>I am blessed to have such an understanding and amazing family. </mark></p>
        <p>Now, I am going to introduce me as a <q>Graphic Designer.</q> I have always been interested in visual creation and communication. It gives me great pleasure to translate thoughts and concepts into aesthetically appealing designs that fascinate and engage viewers. My design journey has allowed me to work on a diverse range of <q>projects</q> from <q>branding and logo design</q> to <q>web graphics and print materials</q>.</p>
        <p><q><em>Creativity is the spark that ignites a positive mind, transforming dreams into realities and obstacles into opportunities.</em></q></p>
